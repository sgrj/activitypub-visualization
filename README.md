# ActivityPub Visualization

A library to visualize the ActivityPub protocol. Used in https://github.com/sgrj/mastodon and on my blog [seb.jambor.dev](https://seb.jambor.dev).

### Random notes

* Start a dev server on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) with `npm start`.
* You can add new activity log examples from [ActivityPub.Academy](https://activitypub.academy/). On https://activitypub.academy/activity_log, press `x` to copy the JSON representation of the current log to the clipboard.
* For the ActivityPub Explorer on the dev server to work properly, start a Mastodon dev version from https://github.com/sgrj/mastodon locally (the explorer uses the `/api/v1/json_ld` endpoint of the Mastodon server).
